## Signing Online Petitions is Easy, but Being Effective in Getting Your Voice Heard Takes Knowledge - and Practice

Have you ever wanted to get involved in government decision making in the United States? Maybe your state legislature passed a bill that you didn't like, your favorite campsite is being closed, or you have a great idea for legislation. In most cases, you have a right to participate in government decision making, whether as a constituent calling your congressperson or by commenting on various project proposals at all levels of government. Being informed about governmental processes will make you more effective at participating, and make it more likely your voice is heard. This non-partisan course aims to help you learn about how different levels of government work, and what you can do to get involved.

## OK, but who are you guys?

We're [Peer 2 Peer University](http://p2pu.org)--we build learning communities
on the web. In the last 5 years, we put together courses like 
[Play With Your Music](http://www.playwithyourmusic.org/),
[Learning Creative Learning](http://learn.media.mit.edu/lcl/), the
[Deeper Learning MOOC](http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/), and
[A Gentle Intro to Python](http://mechanicalmooc.org/). 
Also, we're a non-profit and a distributed team (so we use the tools we recommend).
